If you're unsure as to which file to use, try them both... If that doesn't work, get at me.

2. Extract the folder
3. in the extracted folder try double clicking either of the .jar or .exe files.

## Windows .exe warning
I don't know how to supress this. Our game is open source, the repo is [held here](https://github.com/deenlord/gammacrawler). If you can help, I'd be grateful. Users: This game has no network connectivity, no database, it runs on java and is entirely local. We collect zero data, may the .exe harm your computer? It may. But we are unsure how exactly...

## Mac:
For Mac and Linux: Download the .jar then modify this shell script:

#!/bin/bash 

java -jar GammaCrawler.jar

to match the path of the jar. Run the shell script.
